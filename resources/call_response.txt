Country roads|take me home
To the place|I belong
West Virginia|mountain Momma
I hear her voice|in the mornin' hour she calls me
Radio reminds me of my home far away|Drivin' down the road I get a feelin'\nThat I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
All my memories|gather 'round her
Miner's lady|stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty|painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine|teardrop in my eye
Almost heaven|West Virginia
Blue ridge mountains|Shenandoah river
Life is old there|older than the trees
Younger than the mountains|growin' like a breeze
Take me home|down country roads
